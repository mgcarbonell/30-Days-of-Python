# IMPORTS RECAP
# Importing adds a name to globals()
# Importing allows use to access elements of the imported module
# import math
# print (math.pi) # 3.14
# We can also use * to add almost everything from a module to your global 
# namespace. Though, this can "pollute" our global namespace. Not exactly 
# encouraged.

# WORKING WITH TWO FILES
# import myfile

# What happens when we import a file? Python RUNS the file!
print("What's going on?")
# => "Hello, world!"
# => "WHat's going on?"

# try:
#   myfile.get_user_age()
# except ValueError:
#   print("That's not a valid value for your age!")

# So in a sense it's like JS. Use dot notation <imported file>.<thing we want>
# That's the gist of it: separate things into files and import them!
# Don't give your files the same names as built-in modules.
# Don't create a new file and call it json.py and try to import it because 
# you'll be dealing with your file and not all the other things that come from 
# the python built in json lib.

# YOUR FILES WORK THE SAME WAS AS MODULES

# Everything we could do with external modules, we can dowith our own files!
# importing the whole file import myfile and then referring to things myfile.x
# Importing specific things with from myfile import x
# Aliased imports
# We could even do from myfile import * (although that's discouraged)

# Can we do this with files and folders? Yup, sure can.
# For example, create a folder in your project called user_interactions and move myfile.py into it. Now your file/folder structure will look like this:

# - main.py
# - user_interactions/
#     | - myfile.py
# From main.py you now have to use slightly different syntax to import myfile.py:

from user_interactions.myfile import get_user_age

try:
  get_user_age()
except ValueError:
  print("That's not a valid value for your age! Whole numbers!")

# when importing the . means 'look inside'
# so in our import statement we're saying: Look for myfile inside 
# user_interactions.

# If we have multiple sub folders?
# from folder.subfolder.module import something_from_the_module

# SCRIPT MODE VERSUS MODULE MODE

# When we run a file we say that file is ran in "script mode"
# When we import a file, that file runs in "module mode"
# If we were to do the following:
# put in myfile.py: print(__name__)
# And in main.py:
# import user_interactions.myfile
# print(__name__)
# our output when we run main.py would be:
# user_interactions.myfile
# __main__

# Remember that when we import, we run the file. Therefore the first line of 
# output belongs to myfile.py, and the second line of output belongs to main.py.

# The file that we run always has a __name__ variable with a value of 
# "__main__". That is simply how Python tells us that we ran that file.

# Any file that doesn't have a __name__ equal to "__main__" was imported.

# RUNNING CODE ONLY IN SCRIPT MODE
# We could type this in myfile.py:

# def get_user_age():
#     return int(input("Enter your age: "))

# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     get_user_age()

# EXERCISES
# 1. Split the book reader into multiple files and import
import database
